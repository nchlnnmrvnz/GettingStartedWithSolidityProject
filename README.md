# Project Title

Getting Started with Solidity - A Metacrafters Project

## Description

The project is a solidity-based Ethereum smart contract designed to facilitate the creation, management, and transfer of a custom token.

## Getting Started
### Installing
To execute this program, Remix, an online Solidity IDE, can be utilized. Commence by visiting the Remix website accessible at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

While on the Remix website, initiate the process by generating a new file via the "+" symbol found on the left-hand sidebar. Ensure that the file is saved with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Proceed by copying and pasting the subsequent code into the newly created file:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.18;
contract MyToken {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "Solidity";
    string public tokenAbbreviation = "Sol";
    uint public totalSupply = 100;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;
    }

    // burn function
    function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
        if (balances[_address] >= _value){
            totalSupply -= _value;
            balances[_address] -= _value;
        }
    }
}

```

For code compilation, navigate to the "Solidity Compiler" tab on the left-hand sidebar. Confirm that the "Compiler" option is configured to "0.8.18" (or a compatible version), and subsequently, execute the compilation process by clicking on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

After successful compilation, the contract can be deployed by visiting the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab on the left-hand sidebar. Choose the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu and proceed by clicking on the "Deploy" button.

With the contract now deployed, interaction is possible.
